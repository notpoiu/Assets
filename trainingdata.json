entered Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s outdoor memorial service clutching a protest sign.\n\n> \u201cIf you want the people to feel sad when you die retire before you go SENILE,\u201d it read. \n\n> Feinstein died last Friday at age 90.  Her death came after years of concerns about her health and mental acuity, during which time the senator and others continued to defend her job performance.\n\n> [\u201cI dislike the gerontocracy we live under,\u201d Kim said.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/feinstein-funeral-san-francisco-protestor-18409517.php\n)\n\nFun Fact: Aside from continuing to insist on serving despite being senile for years, voting for the Iraq War and [using her position to award billions in military contracts to a company her war profiteering husband Richard Blum owned](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_C._Blum&oldid=1074506938#Controversy), and fighting to have the Confederate flag reinstalled and flown at San Francisco City Hall, Feinstein also leaked tons of sensitive and private info from the investigation surrounding serial killer Richard Ramirez (The Night Stalker) allowing him to destroy the relevant evidence, evade capture, and continue raping and killing people: \n\n> Three decades before Dianne Feinstein was a United States Senator, notable for not retiring, being rich, giving Lindsey Graham a little cuddle at the Amy Coney Barrett hearings for a job well done, and yelling at children, among, I\u2019m sure, other achievements, she was the mayor of San Francisco. It was in this role that she achieved yet another remarkable feat: aiding Richard Ramirez, also known as the Night Stalker, in evading police so that he could kill more people.\n\n> Netflix\u2019s Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer is an exceptional true-crime documentary that resists the trap of portraying a monstrous murderer and rapist as some sort of crime genius. Instead, the documentary focuses on the real reason so many serial murderers and rapists were allowed pretty much free reign to terrorize people in the 1970s and \u201980s\u2014police inexperience, petty bullshit egos in jurisdictions that refused to cooperate with one another, and, in this case, Dianne Feinstein reciting a list of police evidence on national television for no apparent reason.\n\n> Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo, two detectives working on the case, had painstakingly pieced together a few bits of linking evidence between the 13 murders and even more rapes committed by Ramirez across the Los Angeles area between 1984 and 1985. Police had a shoe print from a notably rare sneaker (only one pair was sold in Ramirez\u2019s size in the Los Angeles area) and a distinct type of bullet. As anyone who has read so much as one detective novel knows, holding back a key piece of evidence or information only the killer would have can be pretty crucial to cracking the case.\n\n> When the Night Stalker attacked an elderly couple in San Francisco, Feinstein, perhaps not a great reader of detective novels, held a press conference in which she offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the killer\u2019s arrest while also giving up all of the clues police had worked so painstakingly to gather and keep from the media including the shoe, ballistics, and information about the car Ramirez was believed to be driving, leaving detectives to start all over and tipping off Ramirez as to which evidence he should ditch in order to keep killing and raping people in California undetected. Ramirez then went on to murder another victim in Orange County after stealing a car before police were tipped off to his identity by multiple friends of Ramirez. Police never found that shoe.\n\nhttps://jezebel.com/remember-when-dianne-feinstein-helped-the-night-stalker-1846087513": 0.503516400584954, "I don\u2019t disagree with the guy": 0.7875291578746608, "She finally hit the ultimate term limit.": 0.7130504698772172, "Stop voting for old people.

Additionally, their diet has changed somewhat over time; while the animal in the past is thought to have primarily eaten vegetation and plants, they now almost exclusively eat fallen fruit.
